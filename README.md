Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my submission for the CodeLeap coding test. The goal was to create a very simple application that performs basic CRUD functions.

## Technologies Used

### Frontend
For the frontend, I used **React** to build the web application. The interface is designed to be intuitive and responsive, ensuring a great user experience. Integration was done with the CodeLeap test server created by me too, according to the instructions provided. 

### Backend
For the backend, I used **Django** and **Django Rest Framework (DRF)**. The API was developed to handle all CRUD operations, ensuring that the application functions according to the provided documentation.

## Features Implemented

1. **Create**: Add new items to the list.
2. **Read**: View existing items.
3. **Update**: Edit existing items.
4. **Delete**: Remove items.


## Instructions to Run Locally

### Frontend
1. Clone the repository: `git clone link-do-repositÃ³rio`
2. Navigate to the frontend folder: `cd FrontEnd`
3. Install dependencies: `yarn install`
4. Run the application: `yarn start`

### Backend
1. Clone the repository: `git clone link-do-repositÃ³rio`
2. Navigate to the backend folder: `cd BackEnd`
3. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Apply migrations: `python manage.py migrate`
5. Start the server: `python manage.py runserver`

## Final Considerations

Thank you for the opportunity to participate in the CodeLeap selection process. This project was an excellent opportunity to demonstrate my skills in both frontend and backend development. I am available for any questions or further clarification about the implementation.

I look forward to your feedback and the possibility of joining the CodeLeap team.

Best regards,  
Welington Morais
